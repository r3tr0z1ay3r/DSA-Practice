## Introduction

This project aims to provide clear and efficient Python solutions to common DSA problems. Each solution includes:

- Problem statement
- Approach explanation
- Time and space complexity analysis
- Python implementation

## Problem Categories

The problems are organized into the following categories, based on the NeetCode.io roadmap:

1. Arrays & Hashing
2. Two Pointers
3. Sliding Window
4. Stack
5. Binary Search
6. Linked List
7. Trees
8. Tries
9. Heap / Priority Queue
10. Backtracking
11. Graphs
12. Advanced Graphs
13. 1-D Dynamic Programming
14. 2-D Dynamic Programming
15. Greedy
16. Intervals
17. Math & Geometry
18. Bit Manipulation

## File Structure

The repository is organized as follows:

```
.
├── arrays_and_hashing/
│   ├── problem1.py
│   ├── problem2.py
│   └── ...
├── two_pointers/
│   ├── problem1.py
│   ├── problem2.py
│   └── ...
├── sliding_window/
│   └── ...
└── ...
```

Each category has its own directory, and each problem solution is contained in a separate Python file.

## How to Use

1. Clone the repository:
   ```
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/dsa-solutions.git
   ```

2. Navigate to the problem you're interested in:
   ```
   cd dsa-solutions/arrays_and_hashing
   ```

3. Open the Python file in your preferred editor or IDE to view the solution.

4. To run a solution, use the Python interpreter:
   ```
   python problem1.py
   ```

Feel free to modify the code or use it as a reference for your own implementations.
